# Design Checklist

## HTML
Map out customer journey through website
Short powerful sections of content
Icons and pictures illustating concepts
Set viewport <meta charset="utf-8" name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Imbed fonts for title and body
Use a visual hierarchy
![Laws of visual hierarchy](img/laws-visual-hierarchy.jpg)
Use a descriptive, keyphrase-focused headline high on the homepage
Long page is better than multiple pages. Scrolling good, clicking bad.
Show one thing at a time, low complexity
Stick to standard layouts
Horizontal navigation in the header
Logo top left
Mobile responsive
Marketing Layout

Use pictures of people with faces, get them to look at something important
Write meaningful subheadings, not generic
No paragraphs longer than 3-4 lines
Avoid jargon, complex words.
Lists have important items at start and end
Answer visitor questions
Add evidence and social proof
Mention scarcity, trigger “loss aversion”
Footer has important links
Call to action button on page for next step
Look at SEO
Use you and your rather than we and our (customer focused)
Check for dead links
